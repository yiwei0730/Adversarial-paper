# Secure and Robust Machine Learning for Healthcare: A Survey
###### tags: `adversarial example` `robustness` `Deep learning`

Abstract : the robustness of ML/DL in healthcare settings which is traditionally considered quite challenging due to the security and privacy issues involved.
In this paper, present some challenge in various application area in healthcare about security and privacy.

Introduction : 
ML/DL techniques have shown outstanding results recently in versatile tasks such as recognition of body organs from medical images [2], classiﬁcation of interstitial lung diseases [3], detection of lungs nodules [4], medical image reconstruction [5], [6], and brain tumor segmentation [7], to name a few.
**It is highly expected that intelligent software will assist radiologists and physicians in examining patients in the near future [8] and ML will revolutionize the medical research and practice [9].**
U.S. Food and Drug Administration has announced the approval of an intelligent diagnosis system for medical images that will not require any human intervention.
Now many recent studies have raised concerns about the security and robustness of ML models. ex: Szegedy et al.
Similarly, various types of data and model poisoning attacks have been proposed against DL systems [17] and different defenses against such strategies have been proposed in the literature [18]
**We want to use ML/DL in healthcare, but we afraid for the robustness and the vunerable of model **

Speciﬁc contributions of this paper
1) We present an overview of different applications of ML/DL models in healthcare.
2) We formulate the ML pipeline for predictive healthcare and identify various sources of vulnerabilities at each stage.
3) We highlight various conventional security and privacy  related challenges as well as ones that arise with the adoption of ML/DL models.
4) We present potential solutions for the robust application of ML/DL techniques for healthcare applications.
5) Finally, we highlight various open research issues that require further investigation.
